# Multi-Agent Simulation using Hugging Face

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a basic multi-agent simulation using large language models from Hugging Face.

### Goal
Explore how different agents can interact via LLM calls in a simulated environment.

### Technologies
- `huggingface_hub`
- Python 3.10
- LangChain (optional for future work)

### Disclaimer
This is **not** part of any academic project or final product. Created as a personal experiment to test multi-agent logic and Hugging Face LLM usage.
